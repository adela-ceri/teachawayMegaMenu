# Teachaway MegaMenu
For this task I have  created a Maven project and used Java to write the script. In terms of Maven I have add all the dependencies in a single file (pom.xml). In terms of OOPS concept and java, I have used inheritance, static key words, Constructors etc.

I have created BaseTest class which contains before and after scenarios that need to be run before and after each class. 

I have created a Test class which contains all the steps requrired to perform the actual tests of the MegaMenu. 

I have created a Constants class which contains all elements locators, in order to make it simple , reusable and easy to make changes. 

I have created a separate class which contains all the data that I have used to perform the tests. This is to separate data from the test, make it simple, reusable and easy to make changes.

I have used TestNG to run and parameterize the tests.

I have used Assertion to validate elements and data.
